This repository is mainly source for all the coding projects I would like to use and learn coding again with JS, C++ or any codes I feel like.
It might break but will see how it goes.

The current uploaded project is following the tutorial for the Plursight course ["Building a JavaScript Development Environment" on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-development-environment/table-of-contents).

All credit goes to Cory House and his course, I founded its better to start from scratch than downloading his source code and understand from reading.
